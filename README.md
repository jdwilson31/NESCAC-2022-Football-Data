# NESCAC Scrapr
Web Scrapes the NESCAC Football play by play data from the 2022 Season. This play by play data is provided by SIDEARM Sports. This scraper reads each play and extrapolates **131** variables of data to be used for analysis. The variables are outlined below. This is the output of code I wrote that is applicable to any SIDEARM Sport football play by play website, however. That code will likely become public when I am done playing football. 

## NOTES
* There are errors based on the inputted data. For example, Trinity College was labeled as Ban instead of TRI for one game and that was fixed. Additionally, not all the information is available online. Notably, the down and distance information is missing from the Wesleyan Bates game from this past year and has been slightly adjusted as a result. 
* Names were the most common incorrect information. I incorporated the Levenshtein distance and other strategies to match names to the best of my ability. 2 names were incorrectly matched as they were different by one character and played on the same team. However 75+ other names were matched accordingly so as a result, I accounted for the 2 names that shouldn't have been matched.
